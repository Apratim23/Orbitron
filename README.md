# Orbitron

A simple, modern Node.js backend template for experimenting with AWS and JavaScript development.  
Created and maintained by **[Apratim23](https://github.com/Apratim23)**.

---

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **Node.js & Express.js** â€“ clean and fast backend structure
- **AWS SDK** (S3, IAM, etc.) â€“ integrate with AWS for learning and small projects
- **MongoDB** (if used)
- **dotenv** â€“ load secrets from a `.env` file
- **ESLint & Prettier** â€“ optional, for clean and consistent code

---

## ðŸŒ± Features

- Loads secrets and credentials from `.env` (never hardcoded)
- Robust `.gitignore` and GitHub push protection to avoid leaking credentials
- Clear separation of logic for easy learning or extension
- Minimal, readable logging and code

---

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Apratim23/Orbitron.git
cd orbitron-main
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```


3. **Configure your environment**
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Fill in your AWS and other secrets (never commit `.env`!)

4. **Run the project**
```bash
npm start
```


---

## ðŸ”’ Security & Best Practices

- All secrets are managed with `.env` files and are **gitignored**
- If you ever accidentally commit credentials, rotate (delete & create new) them as soon as possible in AWS and check your repo history
- Use secret scanning tools like truffleHog, and enable GitHub push protection
- MFA is recommended for all your AWS accounts
